# the Phalangasmic Phone
Probably the only ubuntu phone in hawaii. So cool. Sad that I'm so  bad at understanding how the app service is supposed to be structured.
Displays my Starbucks barcode.

## you want to use this

+ you actually know how to fix my api calls to scrape and inject my account details to the starbucks website

## you dont want to use this.
+ you are not me. probably.
+ you dont have this incredibly sick phone

## dont use this.
